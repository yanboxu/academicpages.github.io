<p>Broadly, my research interests are in statistical machine learning. My current research focuses on techniques for learning from large scale clinical time series data to make individualized recommendations in healthcare. Learning from observational time series data such as those in healthcare and education is challenging because the data are often high dimensional, heterogeneous (e.g., many different signals are measured) and contain many sources of systematic bias (e.g., the doctor or the tutor influences which interventions to give). My interest is in learning expressive representations that tackle these issues.</p>

<p>My research career started at Carnegie Mellon as a graduate student at the Language Technologies Institute. I worked with Prof. Jack Mostow on applications of machine learning techniques to personalized tutoring systems. As part of that project, I also spent one and a half years collaborating with Prof. Zach Pardos as a visiting scholar at Berkeley working on scaling up student models to massive open courses. My research topics include but not limited to Time Series Analysis, Deep Modeling, (non-parametric) Bayesian Modeling, Causal Inference, Dynamic Decision Making and Scalable Inference.</p>
