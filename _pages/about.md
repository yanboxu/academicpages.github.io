<p style='text-align: justify;'>I'm a PhD student working with Prof. Jimeng Sun in <a href="http://www.sunlab.org/">SunLab</a> at Georgia Institute of Technology. My main research interest is statistical machine learning (ML). My current research focuses on developing cutting-edge ML algorithms learning from large scale clinical time series data and generating precise predictions at an individual (patient) level, which enables health care professionals to make data-driven decisions. Learning from observational time series data such as those in healthcare and education is challenging because the data are often high dimensional, heterogeneous (e.g., many different signals are measured) and contain many sources of systematic bias (e.g., the doctor or the tutor influences which interventions to give). My research topics include but are not limited to Time Series Analysis, Deep Modeling, (non-parametric) Bayesian Modeling, Causal Inference, Dynamic Decision Making and Scalable Inference.
