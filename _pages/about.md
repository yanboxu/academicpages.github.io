I am a PhD student working with Prof. Chao Zhang in Machine Learning at Georgia Institute of Technology. My research focus on developing cutting-edge ML/DL algorithms learning from large scale multi-modal time series data and making individualized predictions and recommendations for decision making. My research topics include but are not limited to Time Series Analysis, Deep Modeling, (Non-parametric) Bayesian Modeling and Causal Inference.
