<p>Broadly, my research interests are in statistical machine learning. My current research focuses on techniques for learning from large scale clinical time series data to make individualized recommendations in healthcare. Learning from observational time series data such as those in healthcare and education is challenging because the data are often high dimensional, heterogeneous (e.g., many different signals are measured) and contain many sources of systematic bias (e.g., the doctor or the tutor influences which interventions to give). My interest is in learning expressive representations that tackle these issues. My research topics include but not limited to Time Series Analysis, Deep Modeling, (non-parametric) Bayesian Modeling, Causal Inference, Dynamic Decision Making and Scalable Inference.</p>
